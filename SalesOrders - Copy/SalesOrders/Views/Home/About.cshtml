            Here at The Bike Shop, we've been selling bikes for over 100 years.
            We have an assortment of different bikes and gear to choose from due to
            our store's wide selection of products. Our most popular type is the
            mountain bike and the current best seller is the The Trek 9000 Mountain
            Bike. Our bikes are known for their quality and endurance. Every bike is
            guranteed to last at least 5 years and comes with a money back gurantee.
            Our store is the perfect place for any cyclist to shop.
